I used dynamically allocated memory when created objects and pointers.
It was used when I used the new() function because it will create a 
dynamically allocated memory for the objects. 
Heap.cpp:
line 21: ELEMENT* arr = new ELEMENT[n + 1];  //dynamically allocated
line 29: HEAP* heap = new HEAP(n);           //dynamically allocated

Main.cpp:
line 88: ELEMENT *keyPtr = new ELEMENT();  //dynamically allocated
